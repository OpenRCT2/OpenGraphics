# OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics

**OpenGraphics** is a project established to replace the base graphics of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. The aim is to create a set of freely-useable graphics that can be used with [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2), to decouple its reliance on the copyrighted material from the original game and allow anyone to play the game for free.

## Progress

Replacing every single sprite from RCT2 is a huge project. There are hundreds of thousands of sprites that need to be replaced, and this project is only just starting.
